 ## The Unconference

The main Scala World schedule is a curated programme of invited speakers, but
we wanted everyone to have the opportunity to come along and present.

So in addition to the main programme, we have arranged to hold a "Scala Sunday"
unconference session from 3pm - 7pm on *Sunday, 20th September*, at the Rheged
Centre (the same venue as the main conference) where anyone can bring along a
talk or presentation to share. We would be particularly keen for students who
are currently doing research in Scala to use this opportunity to show off their
ideas, but the opportunity is for everyone.

A number of different-sized rooms have been made available to us for the
unconference, so we will spend the first 20 minutes meeting and planning the
schedule for the remainder of the time. This schedule is likely to accommodate
a combination of talk lengths, from ten-minute lightning talks to 40-minute
sessions, though as a true unconference, we will decide that on the day.
