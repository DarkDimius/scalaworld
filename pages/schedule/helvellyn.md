The well-trodden paths up to Helvellyn make it the most climbed mountain in the
Lake District, despite its status as the third highest.

Starting in the village of Glenridding, on the shores of Ullswater, the
straightforward ascent to the top belies the more challenging opportunities
that arise once you get there: the precarious ridges of Striding Edge and
Swiral Edge, which are not for the faint-hearted.
