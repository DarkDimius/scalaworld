The well-trodden paths up to
[Helvellyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvellyn) make it the most climbed
mountain in the Lake District, despite its status as the third highest.

Starting in the village of
[Glenridding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenridding), on the shores of
Ullswater, the straightforward ascent to the top belies the more challenging
opportunities that arise once you get there: the precarious ridges of [Striding
Edge](http://www.trekkingbritain.com/helvellynviastridingedge.htm) and
Swiral Edge, which are not for the faint-hearted.
