Our main hiking day, several groups will set off from starting points at
Thirlmere, Grasmere and Great Langdale, taking a choice of scenic routes (some
more challenging than others) towards the summit of High Raise, one of the
highest and most central of the Lakeland Fells.

After the lunchtime rendez-vous, and a stop to appreciate the views, there will
be a choice of descents through the delightful Easedale and back into Grasmere,
where a varitety of quaint English tea shops awaits hungry and thirsty
travellers.
